<b><u>Project Title:</u></b>
CoronaTracker For Confirmed Global Cases 

<b><u>Problem Statement/Opportunity:</u></b> The COVID 19 (SARS Coronavirus) has ended up being the most noticeably terrible pandemic in present day history of the human progress. With more than 250 million affirmed COVID-19 cases till date, it is critical that mindfulness about this sickness is spread through whatever implies conceivable.
Subsequently there is a requirement for an web based application where current measurements identified with COVID-19 episode are brought and shown, in a way reasonable by the everyday person, close by gathering information for additional examination.
Tech organizations, government have all reported means to assist with containing the spread of the COVID-19.This brings about colossal significance of web based application the will deal with the information of Covid cases and track it utilizing a world map.

<b><u>Project Description:</u></b> The core idea of my project is working on an opportunity area and creating web based application the will deal with the information of Covid cases and track it utilizing a world map.
This map shows the worldwide location of Coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak. The data the maps consumes comes from Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases, provided by JHU CSSE. We were inspired by the Coronavirus Outbreak Map by John Hopkins University that was very informative. We also recognized the difficulty to gather data for in-depth analysis through various other sources of scattered data on different news portals as well as in different languages.
We also aims to gather data for in-depth analysis and the platform is vital for information consolidation, and all gathered information is open to use for the public.
This project uses the Azure Maps Web SDK which primarily uses map tiles from Azure Maps. Azure Maps provides a generous volume of free usage under the S0 SKU (250,000 transactions a month), which will likely be more than enough for majority of scenarios using this dashboard.
